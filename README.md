Java 8 —— Functional Programming

# Introduction
The repository contains source code for example in the book Java 8 In Action and Java 8 Lambdas Pragmatic Functional Programming. In the meanwhile, there are some extended use by myself.

The source code for example in Java 8 In Action can be found in the directory: [src/main/java/edu/wzm/action](https://github.com/GatsbyNewton/java8/tree/master/src/main/java/edu/wzm/action)
